        <h2 style= "color: rgb(139, 0, 208);"> Well, 1st let's back up a little so that I can explain why my day was so amazing... </h2>
    
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;"> &#x2713; "I made sure to get enough rest </h3>

        <img src="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/sleep/sleep-hero.ashx?h=500&amp;iar=0&amp;mh=500&amp;mw=1300&amp;w=1297&amp;hash=FF914D53688DABF4F78B8911AE759F90" alt="Sleep | Johns Hopkins Medicine" jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" jsname="HiaYvf" class="n3VNCb" data-noaft="1" style="width: 450px; height: 173.477px; margin: 30.5614px 0px;">
        <p style="color: skyblue;"> I function SO much better when I've had 
        at least 6-8 hours of sleep. Sleep is so critical for proper brain function.
        There's a ton of scientific research that I shared with the class. </p>
        <p style="color: skyblue;"> I LOVE TO RESEARCH! Science was one of my favorite subjects in school, and I'm naturally a VERY CURIOUS person. Just how my mind works to make connections and remember things.   </p>
        <h5 style="color:crimson">(Rest and sleep are super important to process new information- like learning a new computer language.)</h5>
    
        <h2 style= "color: rgb(139, 0, 208);">So let&#x27s hop, skip and jump forward to today, 3.1.22. </h2>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; I woke up a little earlier than normal. Even 15 minutes can make a difference.   </h3>
        <h5 style="color:crimson" >(Guess who is not really a morning person? üòÇ Yep, you guessed it right... ME.) </h5>
        <p style="color: skyblue;"> I'm more of a night owl. </p>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke">Life doesn't always allow me to exercise that choice. Living life is about constant adjustment reminder. If you want to learn new things and celebrate new experiences, you have to be able to adjust. And I don't know about you, but I absolutely LOVE new experiences. Doesn't matter if I struggle with the adjustment initially, I will always adjust. That's what I am ABSOLUTELY LOVING about this class and this new experience: learning something new that aligns wih my personality type and interests.  </p>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;"> &#x2713; I took some personal time to reflect and meditate before moving my body. Taking time for my mental health.</h3> 
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; I spoke to someone I love first thing this morning. Reciprocal encouragement and motivation to push through the day were shared. </h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; I made sure to make breakfast.</h3>
        <p style="color: skyblue;">The foods and beverages that you put into your body are EXTREMELY important. Certain foods can improve your brain power. Things like fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, proteins (plant and fish) are REALLY good for you. </p>
    
        <p style="color:crimson;"> Here's a link to a Harvard Business Review article that discusses this very thing: </p>

        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; I sang my heart out in the shower. </h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;"> &#x2713; I packed my lunch and packed my bookbag, slowly and double checked before I zipped it up. </h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;"> &#x2713; I took my time getting ready, which allows me to focus on not forgetting anything. </h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;"> &#x2713; I left the house on time, which allows me not to rush.  </h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; I took my time getting to where I was going.  </h3>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke;" >I love to drive. I don't necessarily love being in traffic, but I have a decent enough amount of patience. Plus it forces me to slow down. I used to drive EXTREMELY fast! Over the years I've learned to slow down, and I only speed when I'm flowing with traffic ...or when I know I can get away with it...üëÆ </p>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke;"> I'm much more of a defensive driver now (following an accident in 2015) </p>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke;"> It was late night. Heading down south on the interstate--the speed limit was 70. I was doing 90. Had a passenger in the car. A blue pick-up truck side swiped me on the passenger side and kept going.  </p>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke;"> I thank GOD that my reflexes kicked in, because while I was spinning- I was still focused on avoiding the oncoming cars and tractor trailers by turning the wheel hard to the right with my foot tapping the breaks to avoid hitting any other vehicles. The car slowed down, but still hit the median and dented the front right bumper and took out my headlight on the right side. </p>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke;"> The car didn't matter to me at this point. I checked the passenger after the impact and immediately reversed the car to get OUT of the fast lane before the onset of traffic came closer. The car was still drivable BUT MORE IMPOTANTLY my passenger was safe. But now I'm much more cautious of other cars. </p>
        <h2 style= "color: rgb(139, 0, 208);"> &#x2192; This is why I love the expression "STAY IN YOUR OWN LANE" &#x2190; </h2>
        <h2 style="color: blue;">...but back to my day, and why it was so FANTASTIC ...</h2>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; I practiced my patience when I was rerouted due to a train</h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; I made it to class on time, in a great mood.</h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">&#x2713; There were some amazing speakers, and I pushed myself out of my comfort zone by asking questions.</h3>
        <h3 style="color: darkgreen;"> &#x2713; AND on top of all of this, I learned something new. HTML. This is my very first page!</h3>
